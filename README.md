# Autonomous UAVs Swarm Mission
## 1. DESCRIPTON
This is a autonomous quadcopter swarm project. The purpose of this project is to achieve a designated mission by multiple drone coorperation. I developed and assembled two sets of drone as the hardware platform. One set consists of six drones modified from 3DR IRIS+ drone, the other set consists of four drones made from scratch. I also developed a drone swarm control software package, including the functions of flight control, multi-drone communication, multi-drone coordination, stereo vision, failure handle, and so on.

There are three subprojects in this repository. 1) The Drone_Matrix_Formation_Flight is the earliest developed subproject, which acheives four drones formation flight. Four dones can form any formation in flight. This drone swarm can be easily expanded, i.e., you can add more drones to this troop. 2) The Drone_Matrix_Curvature_Flight subject is developed based on Drone_Matrix_Formation_Flight. This is a improved version of Drone_Matrix_Formation_Flight, in which the functions are modularized and more functions are added. The drone troop achieves curved path flight by specified curvature radius and degrees. A execution queue is implemented to achieve complex path designation. 3) Drone_Matrix_Balloon_Hunter is the latest developed subproject. It is developed based on Drone_Matrix_Curvature_Flight, with lots of more function added. In this project, four drones coorperate to find and destory four balloons. The four balloons are in four different colors, and each drone is intended to find the ballon with specified color and then destroy it. The advanced stereo vison camera plus sonar system is designed and equiped on each drone. With this stereo vision system, the drone is able to find the ballon and calculate the distance of the ballon. The the drone can adjust its heading and altitude to fly to the ballon.

The leader drone send real time commands to all follower drones, and the follower drones form a specified shape while fly following the leader drone.
